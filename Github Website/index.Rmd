## Project Description
>I looked at listings on Airbnb to analyze what factors of a location affect the overall satisfaction of the stay.
  This is a relevant topic to find out the drivers in how much weight one should put into what kind of experience they will have in an Airbnb. If the price is high, will that mean that it will be a good stay? Or should i consider the neighborhood to be the best indicator of the kind of experience I will be having? Both of these are just some of the examples of realistic questions that Airbnb guests may be thinking of when choosing one location over another, but what is the best predictor of a overall better experience? That is what I hope to at least partly uncover in this analysis.
